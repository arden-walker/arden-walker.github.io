<h1>My wellbeing plan:</h1>
<p>
  My wellbeing plan is based on the Te Whare Tapa Wh훮 model. This model was
  developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1982. It is a holistic approach to health and
  wellbeing that includes four dimensions: taha tinana (physical), taha wairua
  (spiritual), taha hinengaro (mental), and taha wh훮nau (family). The model also
  includes whenua (land) as an important aspect of wellbeing.
