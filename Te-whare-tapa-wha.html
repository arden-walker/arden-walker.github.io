  <h1>My wellbeing plan:</h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      My wellbeing plan is based on the Te Whare Tapa Wha model. This model was
      developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1982. It is a holistic approach to health
      and wellbeing that includes four dimensions: taha tinana (physical), taha
      wairua (spiritual), taha hinengaro (mental), and taha whanau (family). The
      model also includes whenua (land) as an important aspect of wellbeing.
