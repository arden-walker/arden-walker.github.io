  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
  <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway:</h3>
  <p>
    To enter the field of software development, to design an app that will help
    others in their path to learning their heritage, especially in our Māori
    community but still for everyone. To one day take my skills back to
    Australia depending on job opportunities here in Aotearoa.
  </p>

  <h3>
    2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
    learning:
  </h3>
  <p>
    One of my strengths is my willingness to look and think outside the box.
    I've always believed that sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to
    help someone else with their problem or to look somewhere different. Answers
    come from the most unexpected places if you open your mind to
    interpretation. - "Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to
    help someone else” - Uncle Iroh, Avatar the last airbender. My limitations -
    My belief that, asking for help is me being a hindrance/nuisance/an
    incovenience (This will take some serious work, no doubt, especially if one
    of my plans when stuck is to ASK OTHERS for help/advice).
  </p>

  <h3>
    3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
    in yourself while at Dev Academy:
  </h3>
  <p>
    I would like to see my ability to communicate to others improve. I believe
    that a lot of the opportunities/chances that I have missed throughout my
    life have been due to my inability to communicate. My beliefs in not being a
    hindrance on others have played a major part in this and is something I need
    to work on.
  </p>

  <h3>
    4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme: - An
    explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
    with others:
  </h3>
  <p>
    My friendly and adaptable nature should come in handy here. I will use this
    to find the space I am needed, offer assistance where I can and to identify
    the things I know I will struggle with. - What you will do when things are
    building up and starting to get to you: Either look for advice/help from
    facilitators and other members of our cohort and to let others know of where
    and what I am struggling with.
  </p>

  <h3>
    5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
  </h3>
  <p>
    Ask the internet and if that yields no results then I will turn to my peers
    and our facilitators for guidance/advice.
  </p>

  <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</h3>
  <p>
    Guidance, advice and an open learning space. I expect the facilitators to
    help us identify and navigate developer issues and to help place things in
    to context that will grow our understanding. An added bonus is the chance to
    ask what may seem like a silly question - "It's better to ask a dumb
    question than to make a dumb mistake" - Gazza, My old boss.
  </p>

  <h3>
    7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
    to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school
    drop-offs:
  </h3>
  <p>
    I have no other commitments that I know of, however, "never say never" am I
    right?
