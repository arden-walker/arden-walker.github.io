    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h3>When were you blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

    <p class="ono">
      - The problem I faced was from trying to test my answers in the
      JavaScript-Kata part of sprint-4. I faced numerous times where something
      failed, error message's occurred, progress was lost and strides were made,
      yet not made at all and the problem-solving technique's that I used were
      google search, referring back to the Dev-Academy handbook and videos as
      well as asking for help in the discord and although I was welcomed with
      many lines of guidance, the one that not only stuck out but also worked!
      was the advice from Callum who suggested "might be easiest just to refork
      it into a new folder and copy your existing answers over" and BOY! was I
      astounded! An answer so simple and so elegant, yet moved mountains in
      heaven. I will admit that after this profound discovery, I gave up, for 14
      hours, I was furious! As for how did I feel? I think we can all guess at
      that. I've even changed my story telling style because of it.

    <h3>
      3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
      techniques/processes:
    </h3>

    <p class="one">
      -Pseudocode Trying something Rubber ducky method Reading error messages
      Console.logging Googling Asking your peers for help Asking coaches for
      help Improving your process with reflection
    </p>

    <p class="plain">
      - Another I'll be honest moment, I'm nowhere near experienced enough in
      the land of software developer to even know when, why or how to use all
      these methods of problem solving. Other than asking google and my cohort
      piers, none of this come to mind and it's mostly because it makes no sense
      to me. And maybe reading error messages when it isn't written tongues.
    </p>

    <h3>
      4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
      made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
    </h3>

    <p class="title">
      The two things that make me reluctant in asking for help are both the want
      to not be a nuisance and also knowing that asking for help requires time
      for a response. As I've said previously, I'm a very "get it done now" type
      of person and so waiting for a response forces me to not ask. It's the
      impatient side of me unfortunately. Also it's only over the internet, if
      it were in person then I'd ask everyone and everything because the
      response time is almost immediate.
