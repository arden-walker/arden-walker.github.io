  <h1 class="title">Foundations reflections</h1>
  <h3 class="dark-text">
    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to
    the Human Skills learning?
  </h3>
  <p class="ono">
    - That I'm nowhere near as smart as I wish to be. That software development
    is an amazing and sophisticated language that hopefully one day I'll learn
    and be fluent at. That a gentle and kind soul is more important than broad
    shoulders.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dark-text">
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
    programming?
  </h3>
  <p class="one">
    - A piece of the internet that I found on google which I think helps sum all
    my beliefs and understanding in to one. "Empathy is the ability to
    understand and share the feelings of others. For software developers,
    empathy is crucial for creating user-friendly and effective software that
    meets the needs of users, clients, and stakeholders. By putting themselves
    in others' shoes, developers can: Understand user needs and pain points
    Design intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces Improve communication and
    collaboration with team members Build trust and stronger relationships with
    clients Foster a positive and inclusive work environment"
  </p>

  <h3 class="dark-text">
    What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
  </h3>
  <p class="title">
    - That a lot of what is being taught is what I grew up being around. A lot
    of the teachings are embedded in Maori culture.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dark-text">
    What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
  </h3>
  <p class="plain">
    - Other than sticking to the commitments of what I said I would do, nothing,
    truthfully.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dark-text">
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
    focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
  </h3>
  <p class="ono">
    - I want to assume that it is beneficial in every way imaginable eg. Great
    for career development, Improves life quality, Benefits your mental health
    and SOOOO many more things. It just seems logical and truth is, it isn't
    hard.
  </p>

  <h3 class="dark-text">
    Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
    waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
    instead? Justify your answer.
  </h3>
  <p class="two">
    - In some ways, YES. My belief is that, if you need to learn how to treat
    people than you need therapy. As for the professional aspect of it all,
    that's where we need to learn especially for us that have a habit of pushing
    conversation more to the comfortable "friendly" side.
