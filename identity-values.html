<h1>Identity and Values</h1>
<h3>
  1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
  you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made,
  and how you reflect on the decision now:
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  - "Do I ever consider the ethics of a decision?" I ask myself, and after a
  solid thinking session, I noticed that I consider the ethics of just about
  every decision I make. The most recent time that comes to mind is, as I was
  driving, I had a perfect line to take out a possum to which I decided against.
  My reason? because it's a life, it never asked to be here or to be put in a
  position where it will be slain all over the road merely because of where it
  was born and what it was born as. I know that they are considered pest and are
  destructive to Aotearoa's environment but my heart wouldn't let me do it and
  also, if there's one thing I know to be ABSOLUTE! it is that mother nature is
  adaptable. As for how I reflect on my decision? A mental-note that comes to my
  mind is that I abide by my nature and have done so since I was a baby.

<h3>
  2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
  values and identity:
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  - Growing up Maori in a small country town, the thing you're constantly
  surrounded by is family and Te Taiao (The Natural World) and because of this,
  I grew up heavily influenced by my Maori side. It consisted of things like
  Manaakitanga (Generosity/caring) and being that safe place for someone, even
  if its only for a brief moment. Tikanga (Customs/traditional values) and the
  value in respecting others and everything around you. Whakapapa (Lineage)
  knowing where I come from and where I belong to help maintain my character, my
  hinengaro (Mind), who I am and the values we hold. These values helped me to
  navigate the struggles of life throughout my time as an adolescent and are
  things I still hold dear even as an adult. These values (although I didn't
  know back then) helped me and kept me alive throughout my time in Australia.
  They brought me amazing memories, great experiences and even greater friends
  and that's something I'll forever be grateful for. As for my identity, MAORI!

  3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
  journey:
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  - Strength-Testing Results: Curiosity Taking an interest in ongoing
  experiences for it's own sake; finding subjects and topics fascinating;
  exploring and discovering. I think this will help me with creativity.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
  4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
  How might these affect your learning journey:
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  - I think my limitations, truthfully, is that I get bored very easily and
  because of this, I lose focus (although, software development seems to hold my
  attention)
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
  5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
  but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time,
  how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you
  would try now and why:
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  - My most recent job. I have a very "get it done now" approach when it comes
  to work and I admit, I can be very impatient BUT there's also a line of where
  being too patient prevents things from being done. This was my last job,
  everyone loved to laugh and joke (I do to) but when it's to the point that
  there is more laughing and joking then working, it gets old and tiring,
  especially because I'm a thinker and when I'm working I get to think. Another
  thing that made me hoha (annoyed) was how everyone would slack off and talk
  while the work would pile up and so, by the time the morning shift would
  leave, it would be me and two others left to do a hundred trucks. The
  resistance/tension? This was EVERYDAY. The strategy I took? I kept my head
  down and carried on working which bit me in the butt, I was left to do all the
  work while everyone saw it as an opportunity to do nothing. What strategy
  would I try? Tell the bosses.
