  <h3>
    Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:
  </h3>
  <p>
    - Understanding neuroplasticity benefits people by helping them become aware
    of how they react to certain situations. Once we understand our reactions,
    we can begin to change our behaviour, which in turn allows the brain to form
    new or improved neural pathways. This leads to more stable cognitive
    function and enhances our ability to learn and is done by engaging
    neuroplastic mechanisms through learning, repetition and therapy.
    Essentially, neuroplasticity is the brains ability to rewire itself in
    response to stimulation and learning. In simpler terms, after an accident,
    when overcoming addiction or simply learning something new, the brain can
    find new pathways to work around changed or ineffective parts of the brain.

  <h3>
    Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
    benefit / what are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:
  </h3>
  <p>
    - Practice and Repetition, is the best way to cognitively store new
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    - Context, Allowing yourself to find relationships between two different
    concepts helps the brain to recognise and understand something by comparing
    it to something familliar. It also helps to generate greater brain cell
    activity which improves long-term memory and retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
    - Time, is best used to know and understand that you're not going to get it
    all straight away.
  </p>
  <p>
    - Neurological Pathways, should be considered as roads and highways.
    Something I read in our Dev-Handbook: "Like in a system of freeways
    connecting various cities, the more cars going to a particular destination,
    the wider the road that carries them needs to be. However, the fewer cars
    travelling that way, the fewer lanes are required." This proves that
    repetition is key and allowing yourself to see things through the concept of
    highways allows us to grasp the concept a little bit easier.

  <h3>Research Growth Mindset Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h3>
  <p>
    - A growth mindset is the ability to improve your mind through effort,
    learning and persistence. Growth mindset is important because of it's
    ability and it's effectiveness.
  </p>
  <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?:</h3>
  <p>
    - For me, I've been interested in psychology and neurology since I was young
    so a lot of what I read I was familiar with.
  </p>
  <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?:</h3>
  <p>
    - By practising mindfulness and maintaining a repetition is key mindset.

  <h3>
    Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
    learning plan and strategy:
  </h3>
  <p>
    -Being aware of the studies of neuroplasticity, im assuming, will help me
    put everything in to context and allowing me to release mental pressure when
    I dont understand something or when something seems to be to vigorous.
